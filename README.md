# Fibonacci-Sequence-in-Python
The code above is a python program that can generate the Fibonacci sequence, which is a series of numbers where each term is the sum of the previous two terms. The code does the following things:

It defines a function called fibonacci, which takes a parameter called n. This function generates the Fibonacci sequence of n terms by using a loop and updating the next two terms by adding them. It returns the sequence as a list.
It asks the user to input how many terms they want to generate, and converts it to an integer using the int function.
It calls the fibonacci function with the user input as the argument, and assigns the result to a variable called sequence.
It prints the sequence with a message.
